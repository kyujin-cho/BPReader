# Boarding Pass Reader
An Android barcode reader app to manage boarding pass.

A barcode printed on boarding pass has a bunch of datas based on [IATA Bar-coded boarding pass rule](https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/stb/Documents/BCBP-Implementation-Guide-5th-Edition-June-2016.pdf).

This android application parses data from raw text from those barcodes.

This application uses icon from [Google's material design](https://material.io/icons/Â )(Apache 2.0 License)
